    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These Korean Beef Bowls are made with ground beef in the most flavorful
      sauce that you can serve with rice, cauliflower rice, in lettuce wraps,
      and more! This meal comes together in 30 minutes or less and is very
      family friendly!
    </p>

      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sauce</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Garnishes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Green onions</li>
      <li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For Serving</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thinly sliced cucumbers</li>
      <li>Julienned carrots</li>
      <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the beef broth with the cornstarch and mix until well combined.
        Make sure the broth is not warm/hot so that you don’t activate the
        cornstarch. Mix in the remaining sauce ingredients and store in a cool
        place until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the ground beef with salt/pepper. Heat a large skillet over
        medium-high heat and add the ground beef. Cook and crumble for 3
        minutes, then add the onions and garlic. Sauté until the beef is cooked
        through, 5-6 minutes. Drain any grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sauce and bring it to a boil. Let it continue to boil, thicken,
        and reduce for 3 minutes, or until desired consistency is obtained. Stir
        periodically as it cooks. There will be a lot of sauce at first, but it
        will continue to reduce and thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat. Garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, and red
        pepper flakes. Serve over rice, cauliflower rice, or in lettuce wraps!
        (See notes for my method for making perfectly cooked rice.)
